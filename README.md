## osx-voice-questionnaire

The purpose of this program is to help you memorize answers to a group of
questions. It takes a database of questions (in YAML format) and itereates
randomly throught them reading them out with the OSX 'say' command. After 
you hear the question, answer it mentally then hear the correct answer.
If you got the answer right, press Y (Yes) and the question will be removed
from the list. If you got it wrong, the question will be shuffled back in 
the list. The program then asks another random question and so on until 
there are no more questions to ask, in other words, until you know all the 
answers.

This program was originally created to be used to help someone study the
USCIS material in preparation for the civics test in the interview part 
of the naturalization process of becoming a US citizen.
