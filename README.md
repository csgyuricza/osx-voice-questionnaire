osx-voice-questionnaire
=======================

This program takes a database of questions (in YAML format) and itereates
randomly throught them reading them out with the OSX 'say' command. Press
enter to hear the answer, then enter again if you got the answer right or
any other character + enter if you want the question asked again.

This program was created initially to be used as a test for the USCIS

interview part of the  naturalization process.
