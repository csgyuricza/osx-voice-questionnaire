osx-voice-questionnaire
=======================

The purpose of this program is to help you memorize answers to a group of
questions. It takes a database of questions (in YAML format) and itereates
randomly throught them reading them out with the OSX 'say' command. After 
you hear the question, answer it mentally then press 'Enter' to hear the 
answer. If you got it right, press 'Enter' again and the question will
be removed from the list. If you got it wrong, press any other character
and the question will be added back to the list. The program then asks 
another random question and so on until all questions have been removed
from the list, in other words, until you know all the answers.

This program was originally reated initially to be used as a test for the
USCIS study material for the civics test that is given to you during the
interview part of the  naturalization process.
